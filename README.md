Bank Client Segmentation Using Transformers
Overview
This project focuses on segmenting bank clients based on their transaction data using transformer-based embeddings and clustering techniques. The goal is to identify distinct client groups to enable personalized marketing, improve customer retention, and detect unusual behaviors.

Key Features
Transformer-Based Embeddings:
Leveraged transformer models to generate high-quality feature representations from complex, high-dimensional transaction data.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings for better visualization and clustering.
Clustering:
Used K-Means Clustering to segment clients into distinct groups based on their behavior.
Visualization:
Visualized clusters in a 2D space using PCA components to make the results interpretable.
Why Transformers?
High-Dimensional Data Handling:
Transformers excel at capturing relationships in datasets with many features (283 in this case).
Non-Linear Relationships:
They can model complex, non-linear interactions between features, which traditional methods may miss.
Scalability:
Transformers are scalable and can handle large datasets efficiently.
State-of-the-Art Results:
Widely used in NLP and computer vision, transformers bring cutting-edge technology to tabular data analysis.
Steps in the Project
Data Preparation:

Aggregated transaction data into meaningful metrics (e.g., total spending, transaction frequency).
Handled missing values and standardized the data.
Transformer Embeddings:

Used transformer models to generate embeddings for each client, capturing complex patterns in the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied PCA to reduce the embeddings to 2 dimensions for visualization.
Clustering:

Performed K-Means clustering to group clients into distinct clusters.
Cluster Interpretation:

Analyzed and described each cluster in human-understandable terms.
Visualization:

Created scatter plots to visualize the clusters in 2D space.
Results
Clusters Identified:

Clients were segmented into distinct groups based on their transaction behavior.
Example clusters:
High Spenders: Clients with high total spending and frequent transactions.
Moderate Spenders: Clients with moderate spending and occasional transactions.
Low-Activity Clients: Clients with low spending and infrequent transactions.
Irregular Spenders: Clients with highly variable spending patterns.
Visualization:

The clusters were visualized in a 2D PCA plot, making the segmentation results interpretable.
